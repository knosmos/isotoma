## [Browser-based TikZ editor](https://knosmos.github.io/isotoma)

A browser-based editor for the [TikZ](http://www.texample.net/tikz/) language, which is used to create diagrams in LaTeX. It is currently in a very early stage of development; while it is already possible to create simple diagrams much faster than by hand, it is still fairly limited. Additionally, due to differences in the way TikZ and the browser-based SVG renderer handle certain shapes (particularly curves), the output is not always identical to the input.
